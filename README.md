________

This radio application is built using PyQt5 and can:
1. Play built-in radios when you click on them
2. Play radios added by the user
3. Change the color theme using the button on top
4. Has an equalizer (working randomly)

At working:
1. Built-in Shazam
2. Design improvement
3. Multylanguage
4. Delete added radio
5. Normal work with DB

There is still a lot of work, but the application is not being actively developed yet
